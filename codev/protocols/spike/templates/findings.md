# Spike: [Title]

**Date**: YYYY-MM-DD

**Verdict**: Feasible | Not Feasible | Feasible with Caveats

## Question

What technical question was being investigated? Be specific:
- What are you trying to determine?
- What prompted this investigation?
- What decision depends on the answer?

## Research Summary

What was explored during the research phase:
- Documentation read
- Existing code examined
- Prior art found
- Key constraints identified

## Approaches Tried

What was built or tested during the iterate phase:

### Approach 1: [Name]
- **What**: Brief description of what was tried
- **Result**: What happened
- **Verdict**: Worked / Didn't work / Partially worked

### Approach 2: [Name]
*(Add more approaches as needed, or remove if research alone answered the question)*

## Constraints Discovered

Technical limitations, dependencies, and gotchas found during the investigation:
- [Constraint 1]
- [Constraint 2]

## Recommended Approach

*(If feasible)* How should full implementation proceed?
- Recommended library/technique/pattern
- Key architectural decisions
- Things to watch out for

*(If not feasible)* Why not, and what alternatives exist?

## Effort Estimate

Rough sizing for a full SPIR project: **Small** | **Medium** | **Large**

- Small: < 300 LOC, 1-2 files, straightforward
- Medium: 300-1000 LOC, multiple files, some complexity
- Large: 1000+ LOC, architectural changes, significant complexity

## Next Steps

- [ ] [Recommended action — e.g., "Create SPIR spec for WebSocket integration"]
- [ ] [Or: "Do not pursue — blocked by X"]
- [ ] [Or: "Investigate Y further before deciding"]
